# Road Max Fury

Road Max Fury is a game based on a classic car racing arcade game developed in 1984 by Konami named Road Fighter. We planned to reproduce this game as a part of our CMPE 244 project. The goal is to reach the finish line without running out of time, avoiding other cars on the road or running out of fuel .The fuel is refilled by hitting petrol pump which the player can encounter at random location during the course of the game. The player also needs to prevent car from hitting the edge of the road to prevent the collision.
